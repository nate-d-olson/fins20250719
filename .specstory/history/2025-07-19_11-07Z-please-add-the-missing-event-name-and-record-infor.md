To proceed, I need to extract the event names and record information for events 47, 43, 39, 35, 31, 27, 23, 19, 15, 11, and 7 from the provided PDF (`FINAL_Meet_Program_Div_H_Divisionals_07192025.pdf`). Then, I will update `meetData.js` to include the missing event names and record details for these events.

I'll first check the structure of `meetData.js` to determine how event names and records are stored, so I can make the correct updates. I have the structure of `meetData.js`â€”each event is an object with `eventNumber`, `eventName`, `records`, and `heats`. To proceed, I need the event names and record details for events 47, 43, 39, 35, 31, 27, 23, 19, 15, 11, and 7 from the PDF.

Please provide the event names and record details for these events from `FINAL_Meet_Program_Div_H_Divisionals_07192025.pdf`, or let me know if you want me to guide you on how to extract them. Once I have that information, I will update `meetData.js` accordingly.
