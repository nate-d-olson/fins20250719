_**Assistant**_

I'll add a "wrangler" view mode that uses continuous scroll and allows crossing out swimmer names when tapped. This will be useful for meet officials to track swimmers as they arrive or complete events.

Let me implement this step by step:

1. First, I'll add CSS for the crossed-out state and wrangler mode: 
```

```
2. Now I'll add the wrangler button to the view mode toggle: 
```

```
3. Now I'll add the crossed-out swimmers state management and update the JavaScript functions: 
```

```
4. Now I'll update the `toggleViewMode` function to handle the wrangler mode: 
```

```
5. Now I'll update the `updateView` function to handle wrangler mode:
