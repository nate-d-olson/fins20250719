Please add event 3 name and records data from #file:FINAL_Meet_Program_Div_H_Divisionals_07192025.pdf 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you extract event 3 data from the PDF and add it to the `meetData.js` file. Let me start by examining the PDF file to extract the relevant information. Since the PDF file is binary and cannot be read directly as text, let me check the existing `meetData.js` structure to understand how events are formatted, and then I'll ask you to provide the specific event 3 information from the PDF. Let me continue reading to see more of the structure and find where event 2 ends so I know where to insert event 3: I can see that event 2 starts at line 157, and it looks like event 3 is missing (it jumps to event 20, 21, 22, 24, etc.). Let me search for event 3 specifically to confirm it's not there: Let me search more specifically for event 3: Confirmed that event 3 is missing. Now let me find where event 2 ends so I can insert event 3 after it: Now I can see the structure. It looks like event 2 ends around line 387, and then event 4 starts. Event 3 is indeed missing. Since I cannot read the PDF directly, I need you to provide the event 3 information from the PDF. 

Could you please provide the following information for Event 3 from the PDF:

1. **Event Name** (e.g., "Boys 13-14 100 SC Meter IM" or similar)
2. **Records section** with:
   - MCSL record (time, date, swimmer)
   - POOL record (time, date, swimmer) 
   - Team records (CA Team, GP Team, TW Team, RC Team, IF Team, Somerset)
   - ALL* time
3. **Heats data** with swimmers, lanes, ages, teams, and seed times

Once you provide this information, I'll format it properly and insert it into the `meetData.js` file between events 2 and 4.

Please extract the missing information from #file:FINAL_Meet_Program_Div_H_Divisionals_07192025.pdf

_**Assistant**_

I understand you'd like me to extract the event 3 information from the PDF, but I'm unable to directly read PDF files as they are binary format. However, I can help you in a few ways:

1. **If you can copy and paste the text** from the PDF for event 3, I can format it properly and add it to the `meetData.js` file.

2. **I can use a web-based tool** to try to extract the content if you can provide a URL to the PDF.

3. **I can check if there's a text version** of the meet program in your workspace.

Let me first check if there's already a text version of the meet program: Great! There's a text version of the meet program. Let me read it to find event 3: Perfect! I found Event 3 in the text file. Now I have all the information needed. Let me extract the complete Event 3 data and format it properly for insertion into the `meetData.js` file.

From the text, I can see Event 3 is "Boys 13-14 100 SC Meter IM" with all the records and heat information. Let me now find the exact location in the `meetData.js` file where I need to insert this data and add it. Let me find the end of Event 2 more precisely: Perfect! Now I can see exactly where to insert Event 3. Let me read a few lines before and after to get the proper context: Now I'll insert Event 3 data between Event 2 and Event 4. Based on the text file, here's the complete Event 3 information formatted for the `meetData.js` structure: 
```

```
Perfect! I have successfully added Event 3 "Boys 13-14 100 SC Meter IM" to the `meetData.js` file. The event has been inserted between Events 2 and 4 with all the complete information including:

**Event 3 - Boys 13-14 100 SC Meter IM:**
- **Records**: MCSL, POOL, CA Team, GP Team, TW Team, RC Team, IF Team, Somerset, and ALL* records
- **Heat 1**: 6 swimmers (Mascott, Jacobs, Oskvig, Thorpe, Kuran, Widrevitz)
- **Heat 2**: 6 swimmers (Bangert, Solazzo, Guyer, Hodgdon, Donley, Silva)

The data was extracted from the `meet_program.txt` file and formatted to match the existing structure in `meetData.js`. All swimmer information including names, ages, teams, and seed times has been properly included.

run and fix project linting errors

_**Assistant**_

I'll run the project to check for any linting errors and fix them. Let me start by examining the project structure and running any available linting tools. Let me check if there are any JavaScript linting tools available or if there's a configuration file for linting: Since there's no package.json or eslint configuration, let me check the JavaScript files directly for syntax errors. I'll start by checking if there are any obvious syntax issues in the `meetData.js` file: Good! The syntax check passed with no errors. Now let me check the other JavaScript files: Let me check the syntax of all JavaScript files: Great! All JavaScript files have valid syntax. Now let me check if there's an HTML file and validate it: Let me check for HTML validation errors using a basic check. First, let me see if the HTML file is well-formed by checking for common issues: Let me check for unclosed tags and common HTML issues: Let me use a simpler approach to check for common HTML issues: Let me try a different approach and check for specific linting issues that are common in JavaScript projects: Let me check if there are any specific issues by looking at the JavaScript code more carefully. First, let me install and run ESLint to check for common JavaScript linting issues: Let me try a simpler approach and manually check the JavaScript files for common issues. Let me read the `SW.js` file to check for any obvious issues: Let me check the entire `sw.js` file to see if there are any issues: Now let me check the `new_meetData.js` file: Let me now try to run a comprehensive check using Node.js to identify potential issues: Let me try a different approach and check for common JavaScript code quality issues manually. Let me look for specific patterns that might cause issues: The console.log statements in the service worker are appropriate for debugging. Let me check for unused variables or common issues: Let me check for trailing commas and other JSON/JavaScript formatting issues in the meetData.js: Let me check the end of the `meetData.js` file to make sure it's properly closed: It looks like the file was cut off. Let me see the actual end: Perfect! The file is properly closed. Now let me test if the project runs correctly by opening the HTML file in a simple server: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

@agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

_**Assistant**_

Let me try a simpler approach to validate the JavaScript. Since we can't easily run a linter, let me create a simple validation script:
