I'll help you extract event 3 data from the PDF and add it to the `meetData.js` file. Let me start by examining the PDF file to extract the relevant information. Since the PDF file is binary and cannot be read directly as text, let me check the existing `meetData.js` structure to understand how events are formatted, and then I'll ask you to provide the specific event 3 information from the PDF. Let me continue reading to see more of the structure and find where event 2 ends so I know where to insert event 3: I can see that event 2 starts at line 157, and it looks like event 3 is missing (it jumps to event 20, 21, 22, 24, etc.). Let me search for event 3 specifically to confirm it's not there: Let me search more specifically for event 3: Confirmed that event 3 is missing. Now let me find where event 2 ends so I can insert event 3 after it: Now I can see the structure. It looks like event 2 ends around line 387, and then event 4 starts. Event 3 is indeed missing. Since I cannot read the PDF directly, I need you to provide the event 3 information from the PDF. 

Could you please provide the following information for Event 3 from the PDF:

1. **Event Name** (e.g., "Boys 13-14 100 SC Meter IM" or similar)
2. **Records section** with:
   - MCSL record (time, date, swimmer)
   - POOL record (time, date, swimmer) 
   - Team records (CA Team, GP Team, TW Team, RC Team, IF Team, Somerset)
   - ALL* time
3. **Heats data** with swimmers, lanes, ages, teams, and seed times

Once you provide this information, I'll format it properly and insert it into the `meetData.js` file between events 2 and 4.

I understand you'd like me to extract the event 3 information from the PDF, but I'm unable to directly read PDF files as they are binary format. However, I can help you in a few ways:

1. **If you can copy and paste the text** from the PDF for event 3, I can format it properly and add it to the `meetData.js` file.

2. **I can use a web-based tool** to try to extract the content if you can provide a URL to the PDF.

3. **I can check if there's a text version** of the meet program in your workspace.

Let me first check if there's already a text version of the meet program: Great! There's a text version of the meet program. Let me read it to find event 3: Perfect! I found Event 3 in the text file. Now I have all the information needed. Let me extract the complete Event 3 data and format it properly for insertion into the `meetData.js` file.

From the text, I can see Event 3 is "Boys 13-14 100 SC Meter IM" with all the records and heat information. Let me now find the exact location in the `meetData.js` file where I need to insert this data and add it. Let me find the end of Event 2 more precisely: Perfect! Now I can see exactly where to insert Event 3. Let me read a few lines before and after to get the proper context: Now I'll insert Event 3 data between Event 2 and Event 4. Based on the text file, here's the complete Event 3 information formatted for the `meetData.js` structure:
